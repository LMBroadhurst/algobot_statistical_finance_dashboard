# OANDA BOT JOURNEY

### 29/01/23
- Trying to program the bot too fast today left my code erronous, wasting my time with debugging.
- Need to take it slower and understand what I need to include at each step. Keep getting lost on the way.
- Planning is super important and needs to be something I do more of on this project.
