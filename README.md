- [ ] Create my own candle plots and line charts using historical and live data
- [ ] Add simple indicators to the plots
- [ ] Have a suite of more complicated custom indicators
- [ ] Run simulations of how a certain strategy would have performed over 10+ years
- [ ] Use financial data to aid stock investment decisions
